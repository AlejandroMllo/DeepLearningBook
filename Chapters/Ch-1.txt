1 Introduction
  • Deep Learning (DL) learns complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones. DL is the study of models composed of either learned functions or learned concepts.
  • Data Representation is key when finding patterns.
  • Many AI tasks can be solved by designing the right set of features to extract.
  • Representation Learning: discovers the mapping from representation to output and the represen- tation itself.
    – Makes use of an Autoencoder which is a combination of:
      ∗ Encoder: Converts the input data into a different representation.
      ∗ Decoder: Converts the new representation back into the original format.
  • Factors: sources of influence in the model.
  • Depth, in a DL model, enables the computer to learn a multistep computer program (not all the information in a layer’s activations necessarily encodes factors that explain the input). There are two ways to measure it:
    – Based on the number of sequential instructions, or
    – Based on the depth of the graph describing how concepts are related to each other (used by
      deep probabilistic models).
  • DL is not an attempt to simulate the brain. It borrows ideas from different fields (one of which is neuroscience).
